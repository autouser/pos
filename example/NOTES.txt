NOTES

According to the task the customer should have a way to add CSV files and retrieve reports.
I decided that the application should be a WEB interface based on Perl Catalyst.

Catalyst is a flexible, extendable and quick framework.


DATABASE DESIGN

There are three entities in the provided csv:

Customer,
Item,
Order.

Customer and Order have an unique id, but for Item I'm using 'name' and 'manufacturer' fields because different manufacturers can have items with the same name.

Price field should be defined in Orders so if item's price changes it won't affect the report.

You can find the resulting schema at './share/schema.sql'.


APPLICATION COMPONENTS.

There are three DBIx::Class model classes: Customer, Item and Order. Each of them represents a database table.

The ReportDates class represents a view to collect report dates.

Order model have an Order resultset which represents the required report.

The CSV model is based on the Text::CSV module and incapsulates all CSV processing logic.


There are two controller classes: CSV and Report.

The CSV controller is responsible for a CSV processing.

The Report controller is responsible for a Report representation.

I decided also to use the Twitter Bootstrap framework to decorate the project.
